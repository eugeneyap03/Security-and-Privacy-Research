# Security-and-Privacy-Research

Attached is the group report for our chosen topic of Privacy. 

Topics for Assignments 1 and 2
These are the possible topics to choose from for your group projects Assignments 1 (oral presentation) and 2 (written paper). Choose one of the three possible listed topic groupings available for that particular assignment. You must not submit the same work for two assignments. Each of these assignment must be original work.

If you have a burning desire to vary the topic, please contact Dr Shaanan Cohney by 16th August at 5PM.

Privacy

Oral Presentation Topic: Can we have effective privacy without effective anonymity? Explore the effectiveness of anonymity and its importance to privacy.

Essay Topic: ‘Privacy is dead’. Evaluate technical methods that destroy privacy against those that protect it to assess the accuracy if this claim.

Surveillance technologies and the prevalence of commercial data collection have led to a perception that privacy may be dead. Simultaneous, there has been a groundswell of interest in privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). This topic asks you to evaluate the state of the art in privacy enhancing technologies and surveillance technologies to assess the accuracy of the claim that privacy is dead.

Note: While this topic has room for a less technical approach, be warned that this may be a trap as it requires sophistcated argumentation and analysis to do well. This may be more challenging than extracting higher level details from a technical paper. Easier to finish the assignment, harder to do well.

In your discussion some key points you may wish to consider including:

What has changed technologically in the last decade that impacts privacy?
What are the most effective privacy enhancing technologies and do they offset the impact of surveillance technologies in practice?
What is the overall trajectory of the battle between privacy and surveillance technologies?
To what extent and how is AI shaping the privacy landscape?

Breaking Cryptography

Oral Presentation Topic: What are the practical impacts of breaks in cryptographic technology? Explore ramifications for the relationship between nation-states and individuals.

Essay Topic: Client Side Child Sexual-Abuse Material (CSAM) Detection

In July 2024, the eSafety Commissioner tabled a set of regulations to impose requirements on certain digital service providers to take proactive steps to identify Child Sexual-Abuse Material on their services. It is anticipated that a number of large technology companies will be required to implement client-side scanning of images and videos for CSAM. Apple has in the past proposed a system that would scan images on user-controlled devices for CSAM, but that was scrapped due to criticism. It is anticipated that a lawsuit will be filed against the government to challenge the legality of the regulations, and expert witness reports will be filed in the case.

You are a high profile security researcher and write a paper that will form part of a body of evidence used by a court.

You should evaluate the privacy, security, and civil liberty concerns that emanate from hidden code scanning for unspecified content on user-controlled devices. For this topic, you should present a technical overview of major proposals or methodologies, explain the contours of the debate, and present a viewpoint as to what are the implications of this move.

In your discussion some key points you may wish to consider including:

Explain the technical architecture of at least two proposed systems for client-side scanning of images and videos for CSAM
Outline the trade-offs made, both technical and non-technical
Detail the difference in threat models of the government and the technology companies
Present the potential risks that stem from architectural decisions made in the systems
Explain the regulatory and strategic context that might be shaping technology company’s long-term actions with respect to calls for backdooring encryption for the sake of preventing child exploitation and terrorism

Hiding Information in Plain Sight

Oral Presentation Topic: Fingerprinting and Digital Forensics: Explore and evaluate the efficacy of various methods used in digital forensics outside of machine learning, to perform attribution of hacks and malware.

Essay Topic: Fingerprinting and Watermarking Foundation Models

Identifying content generated by foundation models (LLMs, text-to-image generators, and similar) is a major issue for a variety of different groups: media, researchers, industry, education, and government.

Techniques to detect identify such content are a hotbed of research activity. In this topic, your goal is to choose one form of content (audio, text, or visual) and discuss state-of- the-art detect and evasion mechanisms. In your discussion some key points you may wish to consider including:

what fundamental limitations are for each side,
where progress has been made,
where it is still limited,
and at analyses of the impact the current state of the technology may have on society more broadly along at least three dimensions
